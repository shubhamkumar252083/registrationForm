please check "usingDjangoAdmin" branch 

at "usingDjangoAdmin" branch ==>
this is the prototype django application, in which i use django default authentication which is more secure than the main application that i have created on master branch.

i think i had to create this project manually . ie - without using any django default authentication that's why i didn't go for that approch.
because i thought this project is based on php and php doesen't comes with that much of securiety like django.
